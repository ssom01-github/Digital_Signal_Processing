### Installation
To use this web application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/ssom01-github/Digital_Signal_Processing.git

2. cd Digital_Signal_Processing

### usage
To run the web application, execute the following command:

streamlit run module1.py
streamlit run module2.py

Once the application is running, you can interact with the different modules and perform signal processing tasks.

### Modules
The web application consists of two main modules:

##### Module 1: Signal Generation and Statistical Parameters
In this module, you can generate signals with different properties and calculate their statistical parameters. You can specify parameters such as signal type (sine wave, square wave, etc.), frequency, amplitude, and phase and sampling frequency. After generating the signal, the application will display statistical parameters such as mean, variance, skewness, etc.

##### Module 2: Fourier Transform
In this module, you can perform Fourier transforms on the generated signals. The application will display the magnitude and phase spectra of the signal in both time and frequency domains. 

Feel free to explore each module and utilize the provided functionalities for signal generation, statistical analysis, and Fourier transforms.
